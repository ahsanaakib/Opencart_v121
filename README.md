# Opencart_v121
# Project Overview: Automation Testing for Opencart
This project involves the automation of key functionalities for the Opencart platform, focusing on user registration, login processes with data driven and product search. The automation framework is built using Selenium with Java, and it leverages TestNG for test management and reporting.

# Features
* Automated UI Testing for registration, login data driven and search product.
* Test grouping with TestNG (e.g., Sanity, Regression).
* Extent Reports with failure screenshots.
* Cross-browser Compatibility Tests
* run.bat file for executing tests via Maven.
* Jenkins Integration with GitHub for automated builds.

# Planned Features
* Checkout Process Test: Automate the entire checkout workflow, including adding items to the cart, providing shipping details, and completing payment.
* Account Management Tests: Automate scenarios like updating profile information, changing passwords, and viewing order history.

# Note: Please be aware that one test case has been intentionally designed to fail. This is to demonstrate the functionality of capturing screenshots for failed tests. The failure is not indicative of any issues with the application but rather serves as a visual example of the reporting capabilities of the testing framework.
